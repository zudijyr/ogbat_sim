# ogbat_sim
Ogre Battle (March of the Black Queen) combat simulator

Just run ogbat.sim with python (preferably python3.4). You shouldn't need to install anything.

This is still being developed so for now, if you want to change the units or add new characters, you'll have to edit the source code for them.
